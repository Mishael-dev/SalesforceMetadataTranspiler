# Field Documentation: Time

This document breaks down the Salesforce **Time Custom Field XML** and separates the metadata into categories based on how the transpiler, LLM, and UI will interact with them.

---

Stored in `time__c.field-meta.xml`.

## 1. The Outer Container

This wraps the field definition in Salesforce Source Format (SFDX).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CustomField xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
    <!-- Field content goes here -->
</CustomField>
```

---

## 2. Core Field Configuration (LLM Generated)

These are the primary intent fields. The LLM must decide these to define the business logic and identity of the time field.

```xml
<fullName>time__c</fullName>
<label>time</label>
<description>time description</description>
<inlineHelpText>time help text</inlineHelpText>
<required>false</required>
```

---

## 3. Supporting Features (React Flow UI)

These fields are not generated by the LLM by default. They are provided as defaults by the Zod schema but are displayed in the React Flow interface in case the user wants to toggle specific platform behaviors.

```xml
<trackHistory>false</trackHistory>
<trackTrending>false</trackTrending>
```

---

## 4. Others (Transpiler Injected)

These fields are considered platform-required metadata and are automatically added by the transpiler. They ensure the XML is valid for the Salesforce Metadata API but do not require input from the LLM or the end-user.

```xml
<type>Time</type>
```

---

## Json Shape

This section represents the core field definition as a JSON object.

```json
{
  "type": "Time",
  "label": "time",
  "fullName": "time__c",
  "description": "time description",
  "inlineHelpText": "time help text",
  "required": false
}
```

## 5. Validation Rules

This section documents the validation rules applied to **Time** fields at each validation layer in the transpiler pipeline.

### Level 1: Structural Validation (The Shape)

Ensures the JSON matches the Time field schema.

* `type` must be exactly `Time`.
* `label` must be a non-empty string.
* `fullName` must be a valid Salesforce custom field API name ending in `__c`.
* `required` must be boolean.

---

### Level 2: Logical Validation (The Context)

Ensures internal consistency and field dependencies.

* Time fields store values in HH:MM:SS format.
* `required` fields must not allow empty values.

---

### Level 3: Platform Constraints (The Linter)

Enforces hard Salesforce platform rules that are not reliably expressible in Zod schemas and must be checked via custom logic.

* `fullName` (API name, excluding `__c`) must not exceed **40 characters**.
* `label` must not exceed **80 characters**.
* Time fields cannot be unique.
* Cannot be used as `externalId`.

---

### Level 4: State & Conflict Validation (The Pre-Flight)

An optional runtime validation layer that inspects the target Salesforce org before deployment.

* Verify that no existing field with the same `fullName` already exists on the target object.
* Prevent changes to `type` of existing Time fields.
* Validate that the target object is not managed-package locked.
* Detect namespace collisions in namespaced orgs.

Failures at this level should be surfaced as **pre-deployment conflicts**, not schema errors.
