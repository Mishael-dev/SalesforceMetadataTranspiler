# Field Documentation: Encrypted Text Area

This document breaks down the Salesforce **Encrypted Text Custom Field XML** and separates the metadata into categories based on how the transpiler, LLM, and UI will interact with them.

---

Stored in `text_area_encrypted__c.field-meta.xml`.

## 1. The Outer Container

This wraps the field definition in Salesforce Source Format (SFDX).

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<CustomField xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
    <!-- Field content goes here -->
</CustomField>
```

---

## 2. Core Field Configuration (LLM Generated)

These are the primary intent fields. The LLM must decide these to define the business logic and identity of the encrypted text field.

```xml
<fullName>text_area_encrypted__c</fullName>
<label>text_area_encrypted</label>
<description>text area encrypted description</description>
<inlineHelpText>text area encrypted help</inlineHelpText>
<length>12</length>
<required>false</required>
<maskChar>asterisk</maskChar>
<maskType>ssn</maskType>
```

---

## 3. Supporting Features (React Flow UI)

These fields are not generated by the LLM by default. They are provided as defaults by the Zod schema but are displayed in the React Flow interface in case the user wants to toggle specific platform behaviors.

```xml
<trackHistory>false</trackHistory>
```

---

## 4. Others (Transpiler Injected)

These fields are considered platform-required metadata and are automatically added by the transpiler. They ensure the XML is valid for the Salesforce Metadata API but do not require input from the LLM or the end-user.

```xml
<type>EncryptedText</type>
<trackTrending>false</trackTrending>
```

## Json Shape

This section represents the core field definition as a JSON object.

```json
{
  "type": "EncryptedText",
  "label": "text_area_encrypted",
  "fullName": "text_area_encrypted__c",
  "description": "text area encrypted description",
  "inlineHelpText": "text area encrypted help",
  "length": 12,
  "required": false,
  "maskChar": "asterisk",
  "maskType": "ssn"
}
```

## 5. Validation Rules

This section documents the validation rules applied to **Encrypted Text** fields at each validation layer in the transpiler pipeline.

### Level 1: Structural Validation (The Shape)

Ensures the JSON matches the Encrypted Text field schema.

* `type` must be exactly `EncryptedText`.
* `label` must be a non-empty string.
* `fullName` must be a valid Salesforce custom field API name ending in `__c`.
* `length` must be a positive integer.
* `required` must be a boolean.
* `maskChar` must be one of the Salesforce-supported characters (e.g., `asterisk`, `numberSign`).
* `maskType` must be one of the Salesforce-supported types (e.g., `ssn`, `creditCard`, `password`).

---

### Level 2: Logical Validation (The Context)

Ensures internal consistency and field dependencies.

* `length` must comply with Salesforce limits for Encrypted Text fields (1–175 characters).
* `maskType` should correspond to the `maskChar` selected.
* `required` indicates whether a value must be provided.

---

### Level 3: Platform Constraints (The Linter)

Enforces hard Salesforce platform rules that are not reliably expressible in Zod schemas and must be checked via custom logic.

* `fullName` (API name, excluding `__c`) must not exceed **40 characters**.
* `label` must not exceed **40 characters**.
* Maximum `length` for Encrypted Text is **175 characters**.
* Encrypted Text fields **cannot** be unique or external IDs.
* Mask character must be compatible with the selected mask type.

---

### Level 4: State & Conflict Validation (The Pre-Flight)

An optional runtime validation layer that inspects the target Salesforce org before deployment.

* Verify that no existing field with the same `fullName` already exists on the target object.
* Prevent changes to `type` (EncryptedText → other types is illegal).
* Validate changes to `length` if existing data exceeds new limits.
* Validate that the target object is **not managed-package locked**.
* Detect namespace collisions in namespaced orgs.

Failures at this level should be surfaced as **pre-deployment conflicts**, not schema errors.
